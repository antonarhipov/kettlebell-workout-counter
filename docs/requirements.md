# Kettlebell Jerk Tracker - High-Level Requirements

## Overview
The Kettlebell Jerk Tracker is a web-based application that uses computer vision to track and count kettlebell jerk exercises automatically through the user's webcam. The application processes video locally in the browser to ensure privacy and provides real-time feedback on form and performance.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Video Capture and Processing
- The application must access the user's webcam through browser APIs
- Support for selecting between multiple cameras when available
- Real-time video processing with minimal latency
- All video processing must happen locally in the browser (no server uploads)

### 2. Pose Detection
- Integration with TensorFlow.js and PoseNet for human pose estimation
- Detection and tracking of key body points during exercise
- Visualization of detected keypoints and skeleton on video overlay
- Configurable detection sensitivity and confidence thresholds

### 3. Exercise Analysis
- Detection of kettlebell double-jerk exercise phases:
  - Rack Position (starting position)
  - Dip Phase (slight squat)
  - Explosive Jerk (upward movement)
  - Lockout (arms extended overhead)
  - Return to Rack
- Implementation of a state machine to track transitions between exercise phases
- Accurate counting of completed repetitions based on proper form
- Validation to prevent false counts

### 4. User Interface
- Three-widget layout with:
  - Camera widget (left panel)
  - Pose detection widget (center panel)
  - Counter widget (right panel)
- Tab navigation between main screen and settings
- Responsive design for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Visual feedback on current exercise state and form
- Large, readable counter display for repetitions

### 5. Settings and Configuration
- Adjustable sensitivity controls for pose detection
- Configurable thresholds for movement detection
- Persistence of user settings using localStorage
- Options to reset settings to defaults

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Technology Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript for frontend development
- HTML5 Video/Canvas APIs for video handling
- TensorFlow.js with PoseNet for pose estimation
- React Context API with custom hooks for state management
- Vite as the build tool

### 2. Performance
- Optimization for real-time processing
- Frame rate control based on device capabilities
- Resolution scaling options for performance adjustment
- Use of Web Workers for pose detection to prevent UI blocking

### 3. Privacy and Security
- All processing must occur locally in the browser
- No video data should be transmitted without explicit consent
- Clear privacy policy and camera usage information
- Appropriate security headers and Content Security Policy

### 4. Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Alternative text and ARIA attributes
- High contrast mode support
- Optional audio feedback for repetition counting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Clear visual feedback on exercise performance
- Helpful error messages and recovery options
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 2. Reliability
- Accurate rep counting across different users and body types
- Consistent performance in various lighting conditions
- Graceful handling of camera permission denials
- Recovery from common errors without requiring page refresh

### 3. Compatibility
- Support for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Functionality on desktop and mobile devices
- Fallback to CPU backend if WebGL is unavailable

### 4. Documentation
- User documentation with usage instructions
- Code documentation with JSDoc comments
- README with setup and usage instructions
- FAQ section for common issues

## Success Criteria
The application will be considered successful when:
1. It accurately counts kettlebell double-jerk repetitions
2. Real-time processing occurs with minimal latency
3. The UI provides clear feedback on exercise performance
4. The application works across major browsers and devices
5. All processing occurs locally to protect user privacy
6. The three-widget layout is implemented as specified
